Welcome to my website.

I’m Xing Mei, a member of the technical staff at [Microsoft AI (MAI)](https://microsoft.ai/), contributing to the development and delivery of multi-modal GenAI models. My work focuses on creating high-performance and scalable AI systems that advance multi-modal intelligence. Before joining MAI, I led the Vision Engineering team at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), building GenAI solutions that powered a wide range of products.

This site highlights my professional and academic journey. Feel free to get in touch for questions or collaborations.
